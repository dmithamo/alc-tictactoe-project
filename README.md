## Final project for the ALC 2.0 Beginner Android Track

### Introduction
Tic-Tac-Toe is a strategy game which is played by two players, each taking a turn after the other.
It is structured as a 3 x 3 square grid (this app contains a 5 x 5 option) consisting of spaces where a player can place a mark, either an X or an O.

## How to play
1. Player 1 draws an X on a space of her choice on the board by touching the desired space on the grid.

2. Player 2 then places an O on a desired space on the grid.

3. This continues, with the players alternating turns.

4. The first player to make a complete straight line with the symbol she was playing (a row, column or diagonal) wins the game. The scores are updated as applies.

5. If the board is fully marked with X's and O's (no blank spaces) and no player has won (as defined in 3. above) then the game is a draw.

6. Pressing the **RESTART** wipes the board, allowing the players to play again. This option maintains track of the scores.

7. Pressing **RESET** restarts the application from scratch, wiping the board and reverting all scores to zero.

## Future Iterations
A version which allows for single player mode (that is, against the computer) is in the works. Watch this space.
